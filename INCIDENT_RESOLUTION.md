# Critical JSON Parsing Error - Incident Resolution

**Date:** 2025-09-15  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Impact:** Complete application build failure  

## Incident Summary

A critical JSON parsing error in `messages/cs.json` was blocking the entire Next.js application build process, causing 404 errors and preventing deployment.

### Root Cause
- **File:** `messages/cs.json`
- **Issue:** Missing closing quote and comma on line 540
- **Problematic line:** `"5.2. Lhůta pro odstoupení od smlouvy činí 14 dnů`
- **Should be:** `"5.2. Lhůta pro odstoupení od smlouvy činí 14 dnů",`

### Error Details
```
Bad control character in string literal in JSON at position 24981
```

## Resolution Steps

### ✅ Phase 1 - Emergency Diagnosis (Completed)
- Located exact JSON syntax error in Czech translation file
- Created backup of `cs.json` before modifications
- Identified missing quote and comma causing parse failure

### ✅ Phase 2 - Emergency Fix (Completed)
- Corrected JSON syntax by adding missing quote and comma
- Validated JSON structure integrity maintained
- Confirmed all translation content preserved

### ✅ Phase 3 - Validation Testing (Completed)
- Verified application builds successfully
- Confirmed JSON parsing works correctly
- Validated Czech translations display properly
- Checked other translation files (en.json, it.json) for similar issues

### ✅ Phase 4 - Prevention Implementation (Completed)
- Created comprehensive JSON validation script (`scripts/validate-json.js`)
- Integrated validation into npm build process
- Added pre-commit Git hook for translation validation
- Updated package.json with validation commands

## Prevention Measures Implemented

1. **Automated Validation Script**
   - Location: `scripts/validate-json.js`
   - Features: JSON parsing, structure validation, error location reporting
   - Usage: `npm run validate:translations`

2. **Build Integration**
   - Added validation to build process
   - Commands now validate before building
   - Prevents deployment of broken translations

3. **Git Pre-commit Hook**
   - Location: `.githooks/pre-commit`
   - Validates JSON before commits
   - Prevents committing broken translation files

4. **Package.json Scripts**
   ```json
   "validate:translations": "node scripts/validate-json.js"
   "prebuild": "npm run validate:translations"
   ```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `messages/cs.json` - Fixed JSON syntax error
- ✅ `messages/cs.json.backup` - Created backup file  
- ✅ `scripts/validate-json.js` - New validation script
- ✅ `package.json` - Added validation scripts
- ✅ `.githooks/pre-commit` - Git hook for prevention

## Testing Completed

- [x] JSON parsing validation
- [x] Application build success  
- [x] Czech translations display correctly
- [x] Other language files validated
- [x] Validation script functionality
- [x] Build process integration

## Lessons Learned

1. **Large translation files are prone to manual editing errors**
2. **Missing JSON syntax validation in CI/CD pipeline**
3. **Need automated checks before commits**
4. **Better error reporting needed for JSON issues**

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular JSON validation** in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Use translation management tools** for large content
3. **Implement automated linting** for translation files  
4. **Consider structured content management** for legal documents
5. **Add JSON syntax highlighting** in development environment

**Resolution confirmed:** Application is now building successfully with all translation files validated and prevention measures in place.
